# AWS Fargate module

This module creates a set of AWS resources:

- AWS ECS Fargate Service
- AWS Security group for the Fargate Service
- A set of monitoring resources including Slack notifications
- A set of autoscaling resources
- If autoscaling isn't enabled, desires count will match min and max count

### Autoscaling
The autoscaling is triggered by a set of cloudwatch alarms that monitor CPU and memory. Monitoring period and thresholds for each alarm are configurable.
Autoscaling resources have been configured using [Cloudposse `ecs-cloudwatch-autoscaling`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-cloudwatch-autoscaling) module</p>
Both scaling up and down are configured to make adjustments by adding or removing a single tasks. </p>
Scaling-up cool down period is 1 minute while scaling-down cool down period is 5 minutes.

## Verify Module changes locally. 

In order to validate any changes in this repo locally.

1. Push your code up to a brach on BitBucket. 
2. Clone the sr-fargate-module repository. 
3. in the sr-fargate-module repository open the *main.tf* file 
4. Navigate to line 198 and change the *source* property for the *module "fargate-service"* to point to your branch by changing the value of the *ref=* part of the url to be like *ref=BranchName*. 
5. Pull the latest terraform code from the branch by running the command of *terraform init*.
